  jacob "Don't drop the soap around me, they said. One person didn't listen."

  jacob "He said he wasn't scared of me."

  y "Oh no."

  y "Oh."

  y "What did you do to get in there?"

  jacob "Sox Stadium. At night. Josh Silets brought me there. We got arrested together."

  y "Oh, that's not too bad. Trepassing is a misdemeanor."

  jacob "Josh Silets was such a good friend. The world will never be the same without him."

  y "Wait, what happened to him?"

  jacob "He got the death penalty."

  y "What?!"

  y "For trespassing?!"

  jacob "Anish was his defense attorney. You probably wouldn't know him."

  jacob "But he has a way with words."

  jacob "The judge was so moved by Anish's speech, he started crying."

  jacob "The more he spoke, the harsher the sentence got."

  jacob "Somehow, it went from community service to the death penalty."

  y "That's crazy."

  jacob "But the feds had a hard time finding a way to kill him."

  jacob "They tried everything."

  jacob "Shooting him didn't work. He got a pump in at the gym before his execution so he was fine."

  jacob "They tried to poison him, but he's taken so many drugs that he's immune to everything."

  jacob "Injecting alcohol into his bloodstream didn't work either. ABV went up to 100 percent. He was fine."

  y "So how did they kill him?"

  jacob "They screenshotted his NFTs."

  jacob "Then he exploded."

  y "Oh."
