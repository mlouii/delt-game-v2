  y  "Isn't this a fraternity? I guess it makes sense."

  y "I think I hear someone talking... what are they saying?"

  y "They're saying that ... their “Huge Package”... “Came”... in the “Male”??"

  y "I don't know what they're talking about, but it sounds like they're having fun."

  y "I don't want to interrupt them, so I'll just leave them alone."

  y "It was a lot busier back then, but now it's just... empty."

  y "Perhaps the old man is still here."

  y "Why was I even looking at his calves? I don't know. They were just there."

  y "What's written on the whiteboard? It looks interesting, maybe I should take a look."

  y "This wasn't quite what I was expecting. It looked a bit different from far away."

  y "Maybe its a free body diagram? I don't know, I cheated on all my physics tests."
  
  y "That was back during covid."

  y "If it wasn't for covid, I would've been able to stay here. I wouldn't have had to leave."

  y "I wonder what would've happened if I stayed. Would I have been a good brother?"

  y "I don't know. But that's the past."

  y "Moving onwards, we strive for a life of excellence."

  y "I want to make this fraternity a shining beacon on this campus."

  mark "No, its actually way better than I expected. I thought you were going to say 2.5."

  mark "Like all the others..."

  mark "You know, I'm starting to lose faith in this fraternity."

  mark "Like, look at this kitchen. It's a mess."

  mark "And it's not even my mess this time."

  y "I'm sorry, maybe if I rushed back then, I could've helped."

  y "Is there any way I can help turn this fraternity around?"

  mark "It's up to you. I don't really care. I'm just here to steal food."

  mark "Maybe talk to other people. I'm sure they'll be more fun than me."
